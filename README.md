## Project Introduction
Android app that allows mobile prepaid recharge card users to recharge their credit using Barcode, QR code &amp; OCR 
I developed app based on my experience, prepaid users are required to enter a 14-digit long recharge code in order to recharge their mobile
credit via USSD. Smart phones are now available and its users population is increasing at a very fast pace even in third world countries 
thus I developed this app to offer smart phone users a smarter & faster means of loading their mobile recharging codes by using their 
smartphone to read the mobile recharge code using any of the three alternatives provided: Barcode, QR code &amp; OCR.

## Reasons for this app
1. Users are concerned that someone behind them with quick eyes might steal their recharge code by looking at their code over their 
shoulder. This app removes such worries. Noboby can read Barcode or QR code with their eyes.
2. Incase a user mistakenly enters a wrong recharge code they required to re-enter the 14-digit long recharge code all over again. 
This app removes this problem.
3. App offers 3 alternatives to the user. Barcode reader, QR code reader and Optical Character Recognition(OCR).
4. Users are not required to memorize the USSD shortcodes they are required to append before and after the recharge code has been dialed.
The app handles that. This especially useful for multi-sim users.
5. The app automatically detects the users telco operator(s) to configure itself appropriately. No need to configuration hustle and bustle.
    * Telco operator(s)
    * Language
    * Current Country
    * Useful telco shortcodes and services
    * Telco operator theme and signature tune
## Concerns
The project assumed that mobile operators will offer their recharge code in Barcode or QR code in order for this app to be totally helpful to users.
Currently, that is not the case hence the OCR alternative was also added since mobile operators only offer the rechage codes in digits.
